Write a script to do the following:

Start at a path called Github base (dot env: GITHUB_BASE)

Navigate through all the Github repositories in the folder

Write out a CSV called repo-index_{timestamp}.csv

Where: 

{timestamp} is today's date in the following format: ddmmmyy (for example: 21-nov-24).

The CSV should be structured as follows:

path (relative to base)     remote repo url 

- Path is the path of each folder containing a repository relative to the Github base
- Remote repo url is the remote URL of the repo

After gathering the remote repository URLs, remove the '.git' from the end of them.

For example, rewrite: https://github.com/danielrosehill/Prompt-Library.git to https://github.com/danielrosehill/Prompt-Library

After writing the data to the CSV, sort them alphabetically (A to Z) based upon the path.

Here's an example row of data:

/prompt-library   https://github.com/danielrosehill/Prompt-Library
 
Additional instructions:

- Use a dot env with the variable name GITHUB_TOKEN for the PAT
- Many of the repos are private
- Maximise verbosity
- When the script is finished write a confirmation message to the terminal before exiting saying "X repositories written to index"
